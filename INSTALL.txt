=== Prerequisites ===

To build, you will need to have installed CMake (www.cmake.org)

You will also need to install the Boost C++ libraries 
(www.boost.org). If you are not installing these from a pre-built
package, you will need to compile the libraries 
-- program_options
-- serialization

To compile the experiments, OpenCV is required (www.opencv.org)


=== Compilation ===

With CMake, compilation is easy.

cd path/to/sum-of-submodular
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

sospd
=================

Version 0.9

NOTE: This is a preliminary version with the experiments from the papber below. 
Stay tuned for further improvements, like handling larger cliques with structured
energy (i.e., depend on the number of nodes taking a label), and not just given
as a black box.

sospd implements the Sum-of-Submodular Primal Dual algorithm for general
multilabel higher-order Markov Random Fields. See the paper
    "A Primal-Dual Algorithm for Higher-Order Multilabel Markov Random Fields"
    Alexander Fix, Chen Wang and Ramin Zabih. CVPR 2014.

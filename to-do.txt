Simplify ArcIterator by using Boost.iterator
Template out definition of REAL, Label for SubmodularIBFS and SoSPD
Exception safety?
Exception hierarchy, fix assertions to be consistent.
Change how Clique is defined... is polymorphism really correct here?
Figure out design for more structured energy functions than black-box
    Need user-specified transformation from multilabel energy to a binary
    expansion clique
    Need more templating to allow user-specified submodular cliques for
    SubmodularIBFS
Uses of ArcIterator:
    Finding first non-zero out-arc
    Iterating over chain of parents
    Find first arc satisfying predicate
